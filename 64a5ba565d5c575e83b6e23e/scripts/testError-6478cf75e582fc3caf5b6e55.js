/*
* preMapFunction stub:
* 
* The name of the function can be changed to anything you like.
*
* The function will be passed one ‘options’ argument that has the following fields:
*   ‘data’ - an array of records representing the page of data before it has been mapped.  A record can be an object {} or array [] depending on the data source.
*   '_importId' - the _importId currently running.
*   '_connectionId' - the _connectionId currently running.
*   '_flowId' - the _flowId currently running.
*   '_integrationId' - the _integrationId currently running.
*   'settings' - all custom settings in scope for the import currently running.
*
* The function needs to return an array, and the length MUST match the options.data array length.
* Each element in the array represents the actions that should be taken on the record at that index.
* Each element in the array should have the following fields:
*   'data' - the modified/unmodified record that should be passed along for processing.
*   'errors' -  used to report one or more errors for the specific record.  Each error must have the following structure: {code: '', message: '', source: ‘’ }
* Returning an empty object {} for a specific record will indicate that the record should be ignored.
* Returning both 'data' and 'errors' for a specific record will indicate that the record should be processed but errors should also be logged.
* Throwing an exception will fail the entire page of records.
